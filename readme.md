For server-side code use /php/diagnosis.php

This application is created using ionic-angular V6.18.1

The deployable code can be located inside the "deployable" directory

The live website can be visited at http://wind.makeitfortheweb.com
I have deployed this website to an AWS EC2 Linux2 instance

Links to this repo, The raw PHP output and a screenshot of my notes can be found in the footer of the webpage



**Future plans to improve this app:**

There are a couple of good options for improving this app.

The most obvious one being to add a filter, allowing the user to see which parts are slightly damaged, badly damaged, or filter by type of damage
Aditionally, the damage could be randomised to create a sense of realism
Also, I would give the user the ability to change the state of each part by marking it as "Repaired"

On a more Aesthetic note, The ionic framework works better out of the box on mobile devices. With a bit more time, I would add a few more elements to the desktop version of the page to make it look a bit better. There's all this space on Desktop that I didn't really have a use for, this ties in with my last paragraph about extra features. A filter panel and a detail view would do wonders for the appearance of this page.

**Finally**
Thank you for taking the time to consider my application for this role. 

I am very excited for the opportunity to work with your team, and to see how my skills could help Cyberhawk punch it's way up to the next level!
